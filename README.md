## CAMERA TRANSITIONS
Camera transitions are a technique used in films or video editing to move from one scene to another one. They are also applied to video games, but before focusing on them, let's talk about transitions in general.

__When do we use camera transitions?__

If two scenes are happening at the same time and place, it is used a basic cut, with no transition, where the first shot is replaced by the next one.
If we want to give more emphasis to the change of scenes, for example to move forward or backward in time, or to switch to another point of view, we use the camera transitions to get that effect.

## TYPES OF TRANSITIONS
When we want to find information about camera transitions, we find out that most of the famous transitions we are used to see, appeared on TV before its application to video games, so you will see now the types of transitions classified into the ones that are seen on television and the ones that are exclusively on videogames.

### TELEVISION

- __Fade In / Out:__ The scene is turning gradually to a single color. Black and white are the most common ones; fading to black is used in dramatic or emotional scenes, or to introduce the credits at the end of a film, while fading to white is used to create a sense of hope or ambiguity.
- __Dissolves:__ The dissolve overlaps two scenes. The first one gradually disappears while the scene is transitioning from one shot to the next one.
- __Wipes:__ This happens when a shot travels from one side of the screen to the other, replacing the previous scene. It exists the _whip pan_, which is a sub cathegory of wipe, but it tends to be much faster. The whip pan is not always changing from one scene to another, but can be used to change the angle in the same shot.
- __Zoom:__ This type of transitions are used to give the sensation of increasing pace while switching between scenes.

### VIDEOGAMES

Here you will see only some of the transitions that we see in video games, all of them have been extracted from this [website](http://www.davetech.co.uk/screentransitions), where you can find a bunch of really good examples of camera transitions in video games.

## TIPS FOR CAMERA TRANSITIONS
The first important thing to be aware of is that it can look weird if you are using different transitions for every scene, as it's advisable to keep them the same style all the time.

It's not compulsory to use transitions each time you switch between scenes: if you don't want to mean something with the transition, just add a simple cut.

The best camera transitions should go unnoticed, meaning that you feel that it's all belonging to the same environment.
